### Presentation
With Intellisense, the library provides information for easy writing to ajax requests for ASP.NET MVC and WEB API applications. 
The advantage is to have no more hard-coded client-side URL.
When writing of ajax requests, the library allows the developer front-end to retrieve the url generated 
on the server side, to know the structure of data to send parameter and instantiate it.

All proxy objects in javascript are generated and available through the Visual Studio Intellisense for the action methods and business objects.
The URL of action method is also generated.
